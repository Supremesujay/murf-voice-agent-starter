## 🎤 How It Works

The Murf voice agent uses a series of technologies to create a complete voice conversation experience. Here’s how the process flows:

1. **Start Recording**: You click the **Start Recording** button in your browser.
2. **Capture Audio**: The browser captures audio from your microphone and sends it to the backend.
3. **Transform Audio**: The backend processes this audio through **AssemblyAI**. It converts speech to text and detects when you stop talking.
4. **Receive Transcript**: The backend sends the final transcript back to the browser.

Using this technology, you can have real-time conversations with the voice agent.
